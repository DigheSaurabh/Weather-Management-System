# Weather Management System

## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Weather Management System using a MySQL database and Node.js. The system is designed to store, manage, and analyze weather-related data such as forecasts, alerts, and user information. It demonstrates CRUD operations, advanced SQL queries, and database optimization techniques through indexing, triggers, views, and stored procedures.

## Features

### Database Features
- **City Information**: Stores details about cities, including their geographical attributes.
- **Weather Data**:
  - Real-time updates (current weather).
  - Daily and hourly forecasts.
  - Historical weather records.
- **Alerts**:
  - Weather alerts with descriptions, actions, and affected areas.
  - Triggers for automated alert generation based on extreme conditions.
- **User Management**:
  - User preferences mapped to cities.
  - CRUD operations for user data.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
1. **Node.js**: Install the latest stable version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MySQL Database**: Install MySQL and set up a local or remote database instance.
3. **Git** (optional): To clone the repository.

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository
If you havenâ€™t already, clone the project repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-management-system.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project folder:
```bash
cd weather-management-system
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Use `npm` to install the required Node.js packages:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install dependencies like:
- `mysql`: To connect to the MySQL database.
- `prompt-sync` and `readline-sync`: For interactive command-line inputs.

#### 4. Set Up the Database
1. Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or command-line interface).
2. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE weather_management;
   ```
3. Import the SQL schema and data:
   - Locate the provided SQL file (e.g., `schema.sql`).
   - Import it into the `weather_management` database using your MySQL client or command-line:
     ```bash
     mysql -u your-username -p weather_management < schema.sql
     ```

#### 5. Update Database Configuration
Edit the `CRUD.js` file to configure database connection settings:
```javascript
const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  database: 'weather_management'
});
```
Replace `your-username` and `your-password` with your MySQL credentials.

#### 6. Run the Application
Start the application by running the following command:
```bash
node CRUD.js
```

#### 7. Perform Operations
Follow the command-line prompts to:
- **Create a User**: Add a new user to the database.
- **Read User Data**: Fetch details for a specific user.
- **Update User Data**: Modify existing user information.
- **Delete a User**: Remove a user from the database.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure the database server is running before starting the application.
- Use the CSV files in the `data/` folder to populate additional tables if needed.
